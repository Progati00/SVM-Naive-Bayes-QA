# This repository provides an in-depth exploration of Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Na√Øve Bayes classifiers, covering both theoretical concepts and practical implementations.
# üìö Theoretical Concepts:
# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Understanding Support Vectors and Margin Optimization

Hard Margin vs. Soft Margin SVM

The role of Lagrange Multipliers in SVM

Kernel Trick: Linear, Polynomial, and RBF Kernels

Effect of C and Gamma parameters on SVM performance

# Na√Øve Bayes Classifier
Bayes' Theorem and its role in probabilistic classification

Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes

Laplace Smoothing and handling zero probabilities

Strengths and weaknesses of Na√Øve Bayes for text classification

# üõ†Ô∏è Practical Implementations (Python):
Training SVM classifiers with different kernels and comparing decision boundaries

Training SVM Regressors (SVR) for regression tasks

Implementing One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO) strategies in SVM

Feature scaling & selection before training models

Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV

Comparing SVM and Na√Øve Bayes on the same dataset

Implementing Na√Øve Bayes for text classification (e.g., spam detection)

Evaluating models using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrices, ROC-AUC, and Log Loss
